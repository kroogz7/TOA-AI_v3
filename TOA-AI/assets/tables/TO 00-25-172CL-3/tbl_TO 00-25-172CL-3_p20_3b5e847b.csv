CHAPTER 3
E-2 HOT REFUELING
"3.1
E-2 HOT REFUELING."
"The Single Point Receptacle (SPR) and refueling control panel
(Figure"
3-1) are located on the inboard side of the right engine nacelle. The NOT
"FULL lights
illuminate
to indicate
fuel
is flowing into the
tank. The"
"pre-check will
test both the primary and secondary floats
in each high"
"level shutoff valve. Fuel
is carried in two wing tanks with a total capacity"
"of 824 gallons. There are no external
fuel
tanks or weapons. The fuel"
"vent and dump outlets are at
the extreme aft end of the fuselage. If a tank"
"overfills,
the vent system cannot handle the excess flow, so the fuel will"
"spray from one of
the fuel
tank relief valves on top of
the wing at
the"
"outboard end of
the fuel
tank. This sprayed fuel might
reach an engine"
"exhaust,
so to further prevent overfilling,
refuel flow must be
stopped"
when the pilot signals a tank has reached 200 pounds less than full. The
"aircraft has no on board Auxiliary Power Unit
(APU)
and except
for"
"newer models, one
engine
cannot
start
the other. Therefore,
a ground"
"power cart
is needed."
