S-3 HOT REFUELING PROCEDURE
"6.1
S-3 HOT REFUELING PROCEDURE."
"The Single Point Receptacle
(SPR)
is
located on the
right
side of
the"
"fuselage
immediately aft of
the main landing gear well
(Figure 6-1)."
Manual pre-check controls and the tank pressure gauge are located in the
"right main wheel well ""around the corner"" from the SPR. The aircraft can"
"carry 1933 gallons in four
internal
fuel
tanks in the center wing section"
"(inboard of
the wing folds) and 265 gallons in each of
two external
fuel"
"tanks. The external
tanks have no pre-check capability, but can be hot"
refueled. Internal tanks are vented through a single outlet at the aft end of
"the fuselage, while the external
tanks are vented at
the tank bottoms. A"
"single fuel dump (jettison) chute is located at
the fuselage aft end."
"6.1.1
Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The aircraft has an on board APU"
"with an exhaust port on the fuselage left side (near
the running engine)."
"The APU can be running during hot
refueling. The right engine is shut"
"down during hot
refueling."
"6.1.2
Refueling. The
aircraft
carries
up
to
46
sonobuoys
that
are"
"launched from tubes on the bottom aft
fuselage. Prior
to refueling,
these"
sonobuoys are safed by opening a small door just forward of the left hand
sonobuoy chutes. The door has a link that operates a safing switch.
