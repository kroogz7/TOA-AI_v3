| d. Ground the refueling equipment and bond to the aircraft. Route the |
| refueling equipment behind the right main landing gear.               |
| Prior to pressurizing the fuel source, verify the nozzle is locked    |
| onto the aircraft by attempting to remove the nozzle with the         |

| the fueling nozzle. Rotate the nozzle flow handle to the open         |
| position and attempt                                                  |

| (approximately 3 seconds later) hold                                  |
| the right TANK PRE-CHECK switch to SEC. After the right NOT           |
| FULL LIGHT goes out,                                                  |
| the fueling should terminate,                                         |
| if                                                                    |
