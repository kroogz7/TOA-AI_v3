| INTRODUCTION.                                                              |
| This chapter provides precautions and restrictions when refueling aircraft |
| inside a shelter or FTR using an R-9 or R-11 fuel                          |
| truck. Positioning a                                                       |
| truck near or                                                              |
| inside a shelter can create significant space and clearance                |
| limitations.                                                               |
| In most cases,                                                             |
| the truck is outside the shelter or FTR, but                               |
| in                                                                         |
| some critical wartime or                                                   |
| training scenarios,                                                        |
| it                                                                         |
| is necessary to place the                                                  |
| truck inside the shelter or FTR, and,                                      |
| in the case of a HAS/PAS, with the                                         |
| shelter doors closed. The general and emergency aircraft refueling proce-  |
| dures in Chapters 1 and 2 will apply to shelter/FTR operations. However,   |
| some clearance requirements will be changed as described below.            |
| EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.                                                      |
| In addition to those procedures in Chapters 1 and 2,                       |
| if a fuel spill or fire                                                    |
| occurs in a HAS/PAS, open the shelter doors.                               |
| TRUCK/SHELTER CLEARANCES.                                                  |
| Trucks will always be parked outside FTRs with the hose extended its       |
| full                                                                       |
| length. Fuel servicing vehicles can be positioned inside or outside of     |
| shelters. When positioned inside the shelters,                             |
| trucks will be backed into                                                 |
| the shelter on the right or                                                |
| left side of                                                               |
| the aircraft. Except during nose-in                                        |
| or double-stuff conditions,                                                |
| the nearest part of                                                        |
| the fuel-servicing vehicle                                                 |
| must not be closer                                                         |
| then three feet                                                            |
| from the shelter wall or door.                                             |
| (R-11                                                                      |
| fuel servicing vehicles are exempt from the minimum three feet clearance   |
| requirements for nose-in, nose-out, and double-stuff conditions.) Whether  |
| one or more aircraft are parked within a HAS/PAS,                          |
| the FSSZ must be                                                           |
| strictly enforced during servicing operations.                             |
| RESTRICTIONS.                                                              |
| When servicing inside a HAS/PAS/FTR,                                       |
| the following applies:                                                     |
