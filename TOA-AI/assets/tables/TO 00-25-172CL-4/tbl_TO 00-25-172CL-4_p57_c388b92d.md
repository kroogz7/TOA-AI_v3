| ability of omission of a step in accomplishment of the intended task. The     |

| and are not                                                                   |

| Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE). It                        |

| for both normal refueling operations and concurrent servicing operations.     |
| Those steps specific to concurrent servicing operations are in bold text      |
| for emphasis. These instructions will be used by FORCE operators as an        |
| aid to safe and efficient aircraft refueling. Two refueling operators (2F0X1) |
| shall be used for this operation. One to man the R-18 Pumping Unit and        |
| one to operate the R-20 Servicing Platform. However, FORCE was de-            |
