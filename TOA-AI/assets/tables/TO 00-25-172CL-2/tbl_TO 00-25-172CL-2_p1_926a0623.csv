GENERAL."
LOGAIR/QUICKTRANS operate within a prescribed time sched-
"ule to ensure timely delivery of critical
shipments
in support of"
"DOD weapons
systems. Concurrent
servicing contributes greatly"
"to the accomplishment of
this mission. However, concurrent ser-"
"vicing should be limited to “as
required occasions” (i.e., autho-"
rized ground time precludes separate servicing). Efforts should be
made to perform separate servicing at ﬂight originating stations
"and
at
intransit
stations when
ﬂights
are
operating
ahead
of"
schedule.
"This checklist provides,
in abbreviated form, procedures for con-"
"current servicing of commercial “cargo only” aircraft, contracted"
"to
the Air
Force Logistics Airlift
(LOGAIR)
and
the Navy’s"
"QUICKTRANS systems. It
is for use when performing concurrent"
servicing on Military installations only. Applicable aircraft are the
"Lockheed Hercules C-130
(L-100), Lockheed Electra
(L-188),"
"Douglas DC-9, and the Boeing 727. The checklist
is a “step-by-"
step” guide to ensure accomplishment of selected tasks. The intent
"of
the checklist
is to eliminate the probability of a step omission"
in the accomplishment of an intended task. The procedures con-
"tained herein are presented in the shortest, practical
form for use"
"by qualiﬁed personnel and are not
intended to provide full
techni-"
"cal
instructions. The requirements of
this checklist must be ad-"
hered to when the concurrent servicing of applicable commercial
"aircraft
is accomplished on the Air Force installation."
"Concurrent servicing of these aircraft at non-military installations,"
"when in the performance of QUICKTRANS contracts,
is gov-"
erned and conducted under separate authority. Concurrent servic-
"ing is the servicing of
fuel simultaneous with the performance of"
"cargo off/onloading operations, power off nonfuel systems main-"
"tenance,
inspections, or ﬂeet
service. This checklist contains
the"
"steps
necessary
for
preparation
and
performance
of
concurrent"
servicing. All steps are applicable to all aforementioned LOGAIR/
"QUICKTRANS aircraft unless so noted. It
is the responsibility of"
"all
involved functional managers to ensure that personnel partici-"
